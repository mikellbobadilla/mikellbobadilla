# Hi i'm Mikell Bobadilla ðŸ‘‹

I'm a backend developer who is passionate about making contributng to comiunity.
I enjoy working with people, creating new technology that can help people.

I have experience in web development, developing school projects where we worked in groups, in which we learned new skills such as: 
- Agile Methodologies (scrum)
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

I am currently learning backend development. I discovered that this is what I am most passionate about and I want to grow more and more every day.
